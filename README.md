## UX ( User Experience)
### Project Goals :jigsaw:	
The goal of this project is to inform users of services offered by a sports massage therapist and to allow them to book appointments or contact the owner.
The website needs to be visually appealing whilst providing a great User Experience to encourage users to visit the company location and use their service.

### User Goals :jigsaw:	
* A website that serves as an informative tool to help users find the details of the services
* Send a message via contact form
* Ability to see company location
* Ability to read and leave reviews
* Visiual interaction and feedback
* Links to social platforms
* Interact with the website on both Desktop tablet and mobile

## User stories 	:dart:
* As a user I expect to be able to quickly find the locations and opening times
* As a user I want to be able to read reviews of this therapist
* As a user I want to be able to get in touch with the business owner to discuss my needs
* As a user I expect to see a visual feedback when I press a button 
* As a user I expect to know where on the page I currently am while browsing
* As a user I expet to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

## Site Owner Goals	:dart:

* Improve brand recognition in the local area
* Advertise their services
* Receive contact details through use of contact form


## User Requirements and Expectations 	:dart:

* **Requirements**
  * Navigate the website using the navbar/pop-out nav
  * Be provided with information of services and location of the business
  * contnent displayed in a visually appealing manor
  
* **Expectations**
  * Content is visually satisfying and informative on all screen sizes
  * No information overload
  * Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website
  * Burger menu button appeares in place of navbar on tablet and mobile devices
  
## Design choices :framed_picture:	
  
**Fonts**

I chose to use the font **Open Sans** as it was designed with a neutral, yet friendly appearance which compliments the general attitude of this project's design and it's desired function. it can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=welcome+to+waffle+way+&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open&selection.family=Open+Sans:wght@400;600).

**Icons**

The icons used are self explanatory so that the user does not need to struggle to interpret what the icon will actually mean.

**Colours**

Using learned knowledge from prior research, bright and vibrant colours have a higher influence in terms of positivity and therefore more potential sales/leads and interactions.

## Wireframes :straight_ruler:
I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. Started by doing a very basic wireframe for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop - these were to get a basic understanding of how structurally elements would appear on the page. You can view this wireframe in a wireframe folder.
